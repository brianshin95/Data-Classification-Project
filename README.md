# Data-Classification-Project
Project on the default statuses of Taiwanese credit card clients.

We utilized the caret package in R to implement several machine learning techniques on a dataset with 23 variables and 30,000 observations.
These machine learning methods include: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, k-nearest Neighbour, and Linear SVM.
For each of these methods, we applied tuning and resampling methods to idenfity a machine learning technique and its parameters that best predict the occurrence of defaulting.

Achieved comparable results found in the reference paper written by experts, by receiving a prediction accuracy of 82.48%.
